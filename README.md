#Project 64 1.6 Savestate Manager
*Requires [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) and [Joy2key](http://sourceforge.net/projects/joy2key/).*

Uses up to 192 saves (8 savestates in 24 folders), but could be customized to add more with more modifiers
Based on the emacs AHK script found here: https://github.com/Milly/AutoHotKey-scripts/blob/master/Emacs/Emacs.ahk
Uses a joy2key profile that sets the dpad as 0-3, x and y as 4 and 5, left trigger as shift, left bumber as f5 (save-state) and select as f7 (reset)
Press X, or Y, or X and Y to trigger the folder selection, then a number from 0-3 (d-pad) and 6-9 (left trigger+dpad) to choose the folder
Pressing a number from 0-3 (d-pad) or 6-9 (left trigger+dpad) without X or Y before will then select the savestate from the new folder
Folder Names can be customized - just make sure they are ...\Project64 1.6\Save\folder-name\
